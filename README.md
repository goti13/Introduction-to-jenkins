# Introduction To CICD
continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD/is a set of best practices and methodologies that revolutionize the software development lifecycle by enhancing efficiency, reliability, and speed. CI/CD represents a seamless integration of automation and collaboration throughout the development process, aiming to deliver high-quality software consistently and rapidly. In the realm of CI, developers regularly integrate their code changes into a shared repository, triggering automated builds and tests to detect integration issues early. On the other hand, CD encompasses both Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment, ensuring that software is always in a deployable state and automating the deployment process for swift and reliable releases, The CI/CD pipeline fosters a culture of continuous improvement, allowing development teams to iterate
quickly, reduce manual interventions and deliver sottware with confidence.

# What is Jenkins

Jenkins is widely employed as a crucial CI/CD tool for automating software development processes. Teams utilize Jenkins to automate building, testing, and deploying applications, streamlining the development lifecycle. With Jenkins pipelines, developers can define, version, and execute
entire worklows as code, ensuring consistent and reproducible builds. Integration with version control systems allows Jenkins to trigger builds automatically upon code chandes, faciltating early detection of issues and enabling teams to deliver high-quality software at a faster pace.
Jenkins' fexibility extensibility through plugins, and supportt for various tools make it a preffered choice for organizations ain=ming to implement efficient and automated DevOps practice.


# Project goals
By the end on this project you should have:

* Developed a foundational understanding of Continuous Integration (Cl) and Continuous Delivery (CD) principles, and articulate their role in improvina software development processes
* Acquired proficiency in using Jenkins by mastering installation, configuration, and navigation through the Jenkins user interface, and gain hands-on experience in creating and managing Jenkins jobs
* Learned the end-to-end process of automating software builds, running automated tests, and deploying applications using Jenkins, fostering a practical understanding of CI/CD pipelines.
* Apply best practices in CI/CD processes, including parameterized builds, integration with externa
tools, and leveraging containerization technologies like Docker
